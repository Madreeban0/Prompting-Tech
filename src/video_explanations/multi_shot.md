# Multi-Shot Prompting Technique

## Overview
The multi-shot prompting technique is a powerful approach that leverages multiple examples to provide context and enhance the model's understanding of the task at hand. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where a single example may not be sufficient to convey the desired output or when the task requires a more nuanced understanding.

## Implementation
In the `multi_shot.py` file, the multi-shot prompting technique is implemented through a function that accepts a list of examples and a query. The function constructs a prompt by concatenating the examples and the query, which is then fed into the model for processing.

### Example Code
```python
def multi_shot_prompting(examples, query):
    """
    Constructs a multi-shot prompt by combining multiple examples with the query.

    Parameters:
    examples (list): A list of example prompts.
    query (str): The query to be processed.

    Returns:
    str: The constructed multi-shot prompt.
    """
    prompt = "\n".join(examples) + "\n" + query
    return prompt
```
