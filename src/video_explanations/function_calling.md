# Function Calling Video Explanation

## Overview
In this section, we will explore the concept of function calling within the context of our prompting techniques project. Function calling allows the model to invoke specific functions based on the prompts it receives, enabling dynamic and context-aware interactions.

## What is Function Calling?
Function calling refers to the ability of a program or model to execute predefined functions in response to certain inputs or prompts. This capability enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of the model, allowing it to perform specific tasks based on user requests or contextual cues.

## Implementation
The function calling mechanism is implemented in the `function_caller.py` file located in the `src/function_calling` directory. This file contains the logic for determining which function to call based on the input prompt. 

### Key Components:
1. **Function Definitions**: The functions that can be called are defined within the project. Each function performs a specific task relevant to the project.
2. **Prompt Parsing**: The input prompt is analyzed to identify keywords or patterns that indicate which function should be invoked.
3. **Execution**: Once the appropriate function is identified, it is executed with the necessary parameters, and the output is returned to the user.

## Example Use Case
Imagine a scenario where a user prompts the model with "Calculate the similarity between these two vectors." The function calling mechanism will parse this prompt, identify the relevant similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), and execute it with the provided vectors.

## Video Explanation
In the accompanying video, we will demonstrate:
- How function calling is set up in the project.
- A walkthrough of the `function_caller.py` implementation.
- Examples of prompts and the corresponding function calls.
- The benefits of using function calling in enhancing user interactions with the model.

## Conclusion
Function calling is a powerful feature that allows our model to perform specific tasks based on user input. By implementing this capability, we can create a more interactive and responsive experience for users, making our prompting techniques project more effective and versatile.
