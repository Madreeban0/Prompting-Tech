# One-Shot Prompting Technique

## Overview
One-shot prompting is a technique used in natural language processing where a model is provided with a single example to guide its responses. This method is particularly useful when there is limited data available, allowing the model to generalize from just one instance.

## Implementation
In this project, the one-shot prompting technique is implemented in the `one_shot.py` file located in the `src/prompting` directory. The function defined in this file takes a prompt and a single example as input and generates a response based on the provided example.

### Key Components
- **Function Definition**: The core function for one-shot prompting is defined to accept the necessary parameters.
- **Example Utilization**: The function leverages the provided example to shape the model's output, ensuring relevance and context.
- **Integration**: This technique is integrated into the main application, allowing users to easily utilize one-shot prompting in their workflows.
