# Similarity Functions in Prompting Techniques

In this video, we will explore the various similarity functions used in our prompting techniques project. Similarity measures are crucial for evaluating how closely related different embeddings are, which is essential for tasks such as information retrieval, clustering, and recommendation systems.

## Overview of Similarity Functions

1. **Cosine Similarity**: 
   - This function measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. It is particularly useful for understanding the orientation of the vectors rather than their magnitude, making it ideal for high-dimensional spaces.
   - **Use Case**: Often used in text analysis to determine how similar two documents are based on their vector representations.

2. **L2 Distance (Euclidean Distance)**:
   - This function calculates the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It is sensitive to the magnitude of the vectors and is useful when the scale of the data is important.
   - **Use Case**: Commonly used in clustering algorithms where the distance between points determines their grouping.

3. **Dot Product Similarity**:
   - This function computes the dot product of two vectors, which can be interpreted as a measure of similarity. It takes into account both the direction and magnitude of the vectors.
   - **Use Case**: Useful in scenarios where the magnitude of the vectors is relevant, such as in recommendation systems where the strength of preference matters.

## Implementation Details

In our project, we have implemented these similarity functions in the `vector_db/similarity` directory. Each function is designed to take two embeddings as input and return a similarity score.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Implemented in `cosine.py`
- **L2 Distance**: Implemented in `l2.py`
- **Dot Product Similarity**: Implemented in `dot_product.py`

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing these similarity functions is vital for enhancing the performance of our prompting techniques. By leveraging these measures, we can improve the accuracy of our models and ensure that they provide relevant and contextually appropriate responses.
