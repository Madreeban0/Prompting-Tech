# Dynamic Prompting

Dynamic prompting is a technique that allows the generation of prompts that adapt based on previous interactions or outputs. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide contextually relevant responses by modifying the prompts in real-time, depending on the conversation flow or the specific needs of the task at hand.

## Implementation

In the `dynamic.py` file, we implement a function that takes into account the history of interactions to adjust the prompts dynamically. This function analyzes the previous inputs and outputs, allowing it to create more tailored prompts that can lead to improved performance and relevance in the model's responses.

### Key Features

- **Context Awareness**: The dynamic prompting function is designed to be aware of the context established by previous interactions. This allows it to generate prompts that are not only relevant but also build upon the conversation history.
  
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: As the conversation progresses, the function can modify the prompts in real-time, ensuring that the model's responses are aligned with the user's needs and the evolving context.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: By providing more relevant and context-aware prompts, dynamic prompting can significantly enhance the user experience, making interactions with the model feel more natural and intuitive.
