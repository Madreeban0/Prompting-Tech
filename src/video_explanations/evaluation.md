# Evaluation Dataset and Testing Framework

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the evaluation dataset and testing framework used in the prompting techniques project. The evaluation dataset is designed to assess the performance of various prompting techniques, while the testing framework ensures that all components of the project are functioning as expected.

## Evaluation Dataset

The evaluation dataset consists of a collection of samples that are used to test the output of the prompting techniques. Each sample includes input prompts and the expected output, allowing for a clear comparison between the model's predictions and the desired results. The dataset is structured to cover a range of scenarios, ensuring that the evaluation is thorough and representative of real-world use cases.

### Sample Structure

Each sample in the dataset follows this structure:

- **Input Prompt**: The prompt given to the model.
- **Expected Output**: The correct response that the model should generate.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the context or purpose of the prompt.

### Example Samples

1. **Sample 1**
   - **Input Prompt**: "What is the capital of France?"
   - **Expected Output**: "The capital of France is Paris."
   - **Description**: A straightforward factual question.

2. **Sample 2**
   - **Input Prompt**: "Explain the process of photosynthesis."
   - **Expected Output**: "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll."
   - **Description**: A request for an explanation of a scientific concept.

3. **Sample 3**
   - **Input Prompt**: "Generate a short story about a dragon."
   - **Expected Output**: "Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a dragon who..."
   - **Description**: A creative writing prompt.

4. **Sample 4**
   - **Input Prompt**: "What are the benefits of exercise?"
   - **Expected Output**: "Exercise has numerous benefits, including improved physical health, mental well-being, and increased longevity."
   - **Description**: An inquiry about health benefits.

5. **Sample 5**
   - **Input Prompt**: "Summarize the plot of 'Romeo and Juliet'."
   - **Expected Output**: "'Romeo and Juliet' is a tragic love story about two young lovers from feuding families in Verona."
   - **Description**: A request for a summary of a literary work.

## Testing Framework

The testing framework is designed to automate the evaluation process, ensuring that all components of the prompting techniques project are tested against the evaluation dataset. The framework includes:

- **Test Cases**: Each test case corresponds to a sample in the evaluation dataset. It checks whether the model's output matches the expected output.
- **Assertions**: The framework uses assertions to validate the correctness of the model's responses.
- **Reporting**: After running the tests, the framework generates a report summarizing the results, including the number of tests passed, failed, and any errors encountered.

### Example Test Case

```python
def test_sample_1():
    input_prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
    expected_output = "The capital of France is Paris."
    assert model.generate_response(input_prompt) == expected_output
```

## Conclusion

The evaluation dataset and testing framework are crucial components of the prompting techniques project. They ensure that the various prompting methods are rigorously tested and validated, providing confidence in the model's performance across different scenarios.
