# Video Explanation of Token Logging

In this video, we will explore the concept of token logging within the context of our prompting techniques project. Token logging is essential for tracking the usage of tokens during AI model calls, which can help in optimizing performance and managing costs.

## What is Token Logging?

Token logging refers to the process of recording the number of tokens consumed in each interaction with the AI model. Tokens are the basic units of text that the model processes, and understanding their usage is crucial for efficient model management.

## Why is Token Logging Important?

1. **Cost Management**: Many AI services charge based on the number of tokens processed. By logging token usage, we can monitor and control costs effectively.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Analyzing token usage can help identify patterns and optimize prompts for better performance.
3. **Debugging**: Token logs can assist in debugging issues related to model responses by providing insights into how many tokens were used in each call.

## Implementation Overview

In our project, the token logging functionality is implemented in the `src/logging/token_logger.py` file. This module captures the number of tokens used in each AI call and stores them for further analysis.

### Key Features of the Token Logger

- **Token Count Tracking**: The logger keeps track of the number of tokens used in each request and response.
- **Logging Mechanism**: It provides a simple interface to log token usage, which can be integrated into various parts of the project.
- **Data Storage**: Logged data can be stored in a file or a database for later analysis.

## How to Use the Token Logger

To utilize the token logger in your project, you can import the logger module and call the logging functions at appropriate points in your code. This will ensure that every interaction with the AI model is recorded.

### Example Usage

```python
from logging.token_logger import TokenLogger

logger = TokenLogger()

# Example of logging token usage
tokens_used = 150  # This would be dynamically calculated based on the model response
logger.log(tokens_used)
```

## Conclusion

Token logging is a vital component of our prompting techniques project, providing insights into token usage that can lead to better cost management and performance optimization. In the next video, we will delve into the configuration parameters that control various aspects of our project.
